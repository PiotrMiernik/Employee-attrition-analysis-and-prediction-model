HR Data EDA with Python

This is my second project for the data science bootcamp. The goal of the analysis was to identify factors responsible for employee attrition and key characteristics of employees who have left the company.

Data Description:

The data used in the analysis come from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/employee-attrition-and-factors). The dataset was in CSV format and contains 35 columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted including data understanding, data preparation, and data analysis (visualizations, descriptive statistics, attrition rate and mean comparison, correlations).

The data analysis was conducted in Python using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and SciPy.

Key insights and conclusions were presented, along with recommendations for further analysis

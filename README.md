Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction Model with Python

This is my second project for the data science bootcamp. The goal of the analysis was to identify factors responsible for employee attrition and key characteristics of employees who have left the company. Additionally, a classification and employee attrition probability prediction model was created to identify which variables have the greatest impact on the likelihood of an employee leaving the company and to assign an attrition probability for each employee.

Data Description:

The data used in the analysis come from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/employee-attrition-and-factors). The dataset was in CSV format and contains 35 columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted including data understanding, data preparation, and data analysis (visualizations, descriptive statistics, attrition rate and mean comparison, correlations).

The EDA was conducted in Python using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

The classification and probability prediction model was created using sklearn and imblearn. 

Key insights and conclusions were presented, along with recommendations for further analysis
